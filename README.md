The Engine is made up of a Piston, Engine Pole, Cylinder Head, Flywheel, Crank Bell and a Crank. 
The viewer is allowed to rotate the Engineâ€™s Crank either in clock wise or in anti-clock wise direction. 
The viewer can also slow up or slow down the Crank speed.
Most of our application will be designed to access OpenGL directly through functions in three libraries. 
Functions in the main GL (or OpenGL in windows) library have names that begin with the letters gl and are stored in a library usually referred to as GL (or OpenGL in windows).
The second is the OpenGL Utility Library (GLU).
